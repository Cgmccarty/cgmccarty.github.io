I graduated from bootcamp 10 days ago, becoming a full-fledged junior web developer. After 3 months of training and studying,
I realized that I have still learned next to nothing within the world of software development. My basic skills have been well
reinforced, and then supplemented by learning new technologies such as Jekyll, and Laravel. I find myself thinking about coding
on a regular basis, and trying to analyze all kinds of websites, video games, and even my phone. Knowing that I have a lot of learning left to do only drives me to better myself. With a field as diverse and creative as software development, there is always more to add to my repertoire.

Lately, I have been leaning towards front-end development, since I enjoy using CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript the most. PHP is a very interesting language as well, but without a framework, feels too messy for my liking. Learning how to use Laravel definitely helped with that. It allowed me to integrate all of my favorite technologies with the potential to tap into much more that I have yet to learn. I think my next steps will to become more familiar with Laravel, and to also learn some mobile development techniques. That may change, however, depending on where my job search takes me.

The stress of bootcamp has melted away, and paid off. Now, it's time to put it all to the test and become a professional developer.
