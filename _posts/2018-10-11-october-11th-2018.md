Today, we learned some tips to help us get a leg up when looking for a job. Between networking,
researching, portfolios, and even learning more about development. It seems like a lot to try
and balance at the same time. The more I think about everything expected of me, the more anxious
I get. If you're anything like me, then you might feel overwhelmed, too. Learning to manage everything
is a challenge.

After dealing with all of this a bit, I thought to myself, "Why do you think you have to do it all at
the same time?" Simply put... you don't. Take it in stride. You shouldn't force yourself to try and
complete everything all at the same time. What you should try is breaking it up into manageable chunks.
Whether it is learning to use more tools, expanding your code "vocabulary", or applying for jobs, just
try to limit your scope. One or two things at a time feels a lot less crushing than those 20 other tasks
you need to finish.

Remember to breathe, and devote your focus to the task at hand. Have a plan for what isn't immediately in
front of you, so you know what to do, and when to do it. After you have that plan, you can safely redirect
all of your energy and creativity to your current project.
