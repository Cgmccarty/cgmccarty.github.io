    <p>Connor McCarty, here! A little about me... I'm a humble line cook at
    Red Robin, YUM! I live in Lexington, KY with my twin brother (I also have
    2 younger siblings who don't live with us), and three of my friends from
    high school. I am building a family with my girlfriend Kaylyn, and her son
    Kevin. I am a big horror movie buff, and I love to play video games in my
    spare time.</p>
