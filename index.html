    <p>Connor McCarty, here! A little about me... I was born in Morehead, KY, grew up in Winchester, KY, and now I live in Nicholasville, KY, with my girlfriend Kaylyn, and son, Kevin.
      I have a twin brother, as well as a younger brother and sister. I have worked a lot of fast food, and a lot of retail...
      but now I'm ready for bigger and better things! What made me most interested in programming is the logic of it. Computers
      seem very sensible to me. I've always been a 3D thinker; sort of like creating a map to whatever is in front of you, but
      in your head! I am a big horror movie buff (although, I'll watch just about anything), and I love to play video games in my spare time.</p>
