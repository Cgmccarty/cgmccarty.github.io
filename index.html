        <p class="card-body text-light">Connor McCarty, here! A little about me... I was born in Morehead, KY, grew up in Winchester, KY, and now I live in Nicholasville, KY.
            I have a twin brother, as well as a younger brother and sister. Hectic environments are not new to me. I have worked a lot of fast food, and a lot of retail...
            but now I'm ready for bigger and better things! I am now a junior software developer after graduating from the Awesome Inc. U Bootcamp. I've always been a 3D
            thinker; sort of like creating a map to whatever is in front of you, but in your head! I am a big horror movie buff (although,
            I'll watch just about anything). When I am not working on my next project, I unwind with my Xbox.
        </p>

        <p class="card-body text-light">Check out my blog if you're interested. It's just my thoughts on becoming a software developer, and the Awesome Inc. U Bootcamp.
            and be sure to check out some of my projects while you're at it!
